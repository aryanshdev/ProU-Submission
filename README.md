## About

I have created a Employee Management System for my submission in Track 1 & 2 & 3.<br />
The System Works on Both Mock Data (Track 1) and Actual Real Data stored in Database and Fetched via APIs (Track 2 & 3)
### System Architecture
The Prototype is very simple and uses as fairly simple architecture. I given time I can also make this scalable by dividing the system into microservices and adding brokers like Kafka.
